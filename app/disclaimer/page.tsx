                        The content, services, and resources provided by VIDHYAPEET SKILL INTERN
                        PRIVATE LIMITED through our website, mobile app, courses, and live
                        sessions are meant for educational and informational purposes only.
                        While we aim to offer accurate and up-to-date learning materials, we
                        do not guarantee the completeness, reliability, or effectiveness of
                        any course or content.

                    <p>
                        By using our platform, you understand and agree that Skill Intern is
                        not responsible for any errors, omissions, or consequences that may
                        arise from the use of our educational material. All content is
                        provided "as is" and "as available," without any express or implied
                        warranties.

                    <p>
                        We do not promise job placements or guaranteed career outcomes. While
                        we offer placement support, interview preparation, internships, and
                        career guidance, the final results depend entirely on your individual
                        performance, effort, eligibility, and current job market conditions.
                        Our programs are designed to support your skill development—not to
                        serve as guaranteed employment pathways.

                        Occasionally, we may share third-party links or external resources for
                        reference or added learning. These are provided for convenience only,
                        and we are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or policies of
                        those external sites.

                        internet connection and compatible devices to access our courses
                        smoothly.
