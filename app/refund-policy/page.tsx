                        Refund & Cancellation Policy – VIDHYAPEET SKILL INTERN PRIVATE LIMITED
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At VIDHYAPEET SKILL INTERN PRIVATE LIMITED, we are committed to
                        offering high-quality online education through live classes,
                        recorded sessions, certification programs, internships, and
                        placement support. We understand that sometimes learners may need to
                        reconsider their enrollment. This policy explains how refunds and
                        cancellations are handled.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By enrolling in any course or service through our website or mobile
                        application, you confirm that you agree to this policy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you enroll and gain access to live classes, recorded videos,
                        course materials, or internship projects, your course is considered
                        active. At this stage, no refund will be provided under normal
                        circumstances, as the digital content is already delivered and
                        learning resources are allocated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, in rare cases—such as technical errors during payment,
                        duplicate charges, or platform issues—you may request a refund. Such
                        requests must be emailed to **Operation@skillintern.in** within
                        three days of the transaction. Each request will be reviewed
                        individually, and you’ll receive a response within three working
                        days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Refund approvals are based on your course access, progress, and
                        engagement level. If approved, the refund will be processed to your
                        original payment method and may take three business days,
                        depending on your bank or payment provider.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may request a course cancellation before it begins (i.e., before
                        you access any content or attend a class). Once the course starts,
                        or access is granted, cancellation and refund are not possible. No
                        refunds will be issued for inactivity, voluntary discontinuation, or
                        missed sessions.
                    </p>

                        We advise all learners to carefully review course details,
                        schedules, and available demos before making any payment. If you
                        have doubts or need more clarity, feel free to reach out to our
                        support team before enrolling.
