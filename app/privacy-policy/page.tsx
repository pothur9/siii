                        This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Terms and Conditions of
                        VIDHYAPEET SKILL INTERN PRIVATE LIMITED and governs the manner in
                        which we collect, use, maintain, and disclose information collected
                        from users (referred to as “you” or “learners”) of our website,
                        applications, and digital learning platforms. By accessing or using
                        any part of the Skill Intern website or services, you expressly agree
                        to the collection and use of your personal data in accordance with
                        this Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
                        ensuring that your personal information is handled securely and
                        responsibly. Should we request certain details by which you can be
                        identified while using our platform, you can be assured that the
                        information will be used strictly in accordance with this policy. We
                        recommend reviewing this page regularly to stay informed about any

                        By using our website, mobile applications, and services, you agree
                        to the terms of this Privacy Policy and explicitly consent to the
                        processing of your personal information as outlined herein. In order
                        to deliver our career-focused courses, internship opportunities, and
                        placement training, we may request basic personal information such
                        as your name, email address, age (for eligibility confirmation),
                        phone number, academic details, and other relevant data to create a
                        personalized learning experience. If you are a parent or guardian
                        registering on behalf of a student, you may be asked to provide
                        optional details about the learner to ensure age-appropriate content
                        and communication. Skill Intern does not sell or rent personal data
                        to third parties for marketing purposes. Your data will only be
                        accessed by our authorized employees or partners who require it to
                        provide services or respond to queries via phone or email

                        Our website uses cookies, device identifiers, and image tags to
                        enhance your experience. Cookies are small data files stored in your
                        web browser, while device identifiers are unique codes that help us
                        recognize your mobile or desktop device. Additionally, we may use
                        web beacons (also called tracking pixels) to monitor website
                        activity and deliver features that improve usability. While you may
                        decline the use of cookies through your browser settings, please
                        note that certain features on the Skill Intern platform may not
                        function as intended without them.

                    <p>
                        We may collect, process, and analyze your feedback to improve the
                        quality of our educational offerings. Feedback may be published or
                        shared internally for the purpose of enhancing our user experience,
                        but it will not be linked to your personally identifiable
                        information without your permission. Skill Intern uses personal data
                        primarily to provide seamless access to our online courses, career
                        guidance services, mentorship, and live classes. In rare cases, our
                        team may need to access specific user information while developing
                        or troubleshooting the platform, resolving support tickets,
                        verifying compliance with our terms of use, or improving user
                        experience through data-driven enhancements. Additionally, our
                        customer support team may access limited user data to assist you
                        with queries or issues. Information may also be compared with
                        third-party databases to verify accuracy, prevent fraud, or fulfill
                        legal obligations.

                    <p>
                        We may monitor user activity across our platform to ensure
                        compliance with our community guidelines and to refine our services
                        through analytical insights. Skill Intern may occasionally contact
                        you via phone, email, or SMS for administrative purposes,
                        transaction confirmations, customer service responses, or
                        promotional messages such as newsletters, webinar invites, or new
                        course launches. You may choose to unsubscribe from promotional
                        messages at any time, though certain administrative emails related
                        to your enrolled courses may remain active unless you deactivate
                        your account. If you subscribed to Skill Intern services via a
                        partner or third-party platform, you must adjust your preferences
                        directly with them.

                    <p>
                        Skill Intern does not knowingly collect personal data from children
                        under the age of 17. If we learn that a user under this age has
                        registered without verified parental consent, we will take immediate
                        steps to delete their data. The safety of young learners is a
                        priority, and our platform is designed for learners aged 17 and
                        above, in accordance with academic and professional readiness.

                    <p>
                        We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to
                        protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
                        disclosure, alteration, or destruction. All sensitive data is
                        encrypted and stored securely within our systems. Access to this
                        data is strictly limited to trained personnel who are bound by
                        confidentiality obligations.

                        Our platform may contain links to external websites or third-party
                        services for your convenience. Please be aware that these
                        third-party platforms have independent privacy policies and terms of
                        use, which we do not control. We encourage users to review those

                        features. Any changes will be posted on this page, and material
                        changes may also be communicated via email. We recommend reviewing

                        Skill Intern may use aggregated, anonymized data derived from your
                        personal information for statistical research, business
                        intelligence, and platform improvement. This non-identifiable data
                        may be shared with partners or affiliates to help enhance the reach
                        and relevance of our educational offerings. All Skill Intern staff,
                        vendors, and third-party processors involved in handling sensitive

                        to strict confidentiality protocols.

                        In some cases, we may collect information about your location (such
                        as country or city) to customize your experience, content language,
                        or course recommendations. However, we do not collect your exact
                        GPS-based location. You can modify location access permissions
                        within your device settings.

                        to protect your privacy.
